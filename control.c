Master Pins
Pin 2(GPIO/Latching) -  Open the Master Valve.
Pin 3(GPIO/Latching) -  Close the Master Valve
Pin 4(GPIO) - Activate Power Source (120vac) - Solid State Relay

Channel Pins
Pin 8(GPIO) - Cause a voltage across the edr to be from left to right (120vdc)
Pin 9(GPIO) - Cause a voltage across the edr to be from right to left (120vdc)
Pin 10(GPIO/Latching) -
	1) Make the clean water come out of the top manifold
	2) Make the salty circulation flow through the bottom manifolds
Pin 11(GPIO/Latching) -
	1) Make the clean water come out of the bottom manifold
	2) Make the salty circulation flow through the top manifolds

Circulation Pins
Pin 12(GPIO) - Open the Dump valve. The valve will remain open as long as this pin is active.
Pin 13(GPIO) - Activate the circulation pump. The pump will remain active as long as this pin is active.

/*
Cycle Specifications
There are 5 cycles: (Off, Prime, Channel A, Channel B, and Dump)

Off
This is the low power state. The only thing energized is the artik. Master Pins are off.

Prime
The Artik decides when to turn the machine on. Master pin 8 flips on (100ms). Once on, Eddi starts a priming cycle. In this cycle, Channel A valves are clean, Channel B valves are dirty, and the dump valve is open. The dump valve closes when the recirculation flow sensor reads a steady-state flow rate that is greater than zero. The priming cycle stops 5 minutes after the dump valve is closed (for wetting the membranes).

Channel A
This is a desalination cycle. Channel A valves are clean, Channel B valves are dirty, dump valve is closed. The graphite is in state A.

Channel B
This is a desalination cycle. Channel B valves are clean, Channel A valves are dirty, dump valve is closed. The graphite is in state B.

Dump
This is a state where salty recirculation water is being dumped. To trigger this state, the previous channel cycle must detect a high salinity in the recirculation channel (or take 15 minutes if no salinity sensor in recirc). The channel valves remain unchanged from their previous state. Recirc pump is on. Dump Valve is open. This state remains on until the salinity of the recirculation channel returns to a steady-state level (or 30 seconds if no salinity sensor in recirc). After the dump cycle, the dump valve closes, and the Artik determines if there should be another round of desalination (based on scheduling). If there should be another round, the Artik flips to the channel that it wasnâ€™t just on.
